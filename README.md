Implementation of the classical substitution cipher.  
Supports encryption and decryption using customizable key shifts.

### 2. Gaming Cipher
Custom cipher developed as part of a creative cryptography assignment.  
Demonstrates algorithm design, symbolic mapping, and decoding logic.

### 3. Trithemius Cipher
Polyalphabetic cipher with character shifting based on word indices.  
Includes frequency analysis and key generation utilities.

### 4. Knapsack Cipher
Implementation of the Merkle–Hellman knapsack public-key cryptosystem.  
Includes modular arithmetic operations and key pair generation.

### 5. Diffie–Hellman Protocol
Simulation of the Diffie–Hellman key exchange algorithm.  
Demonstrates secure shared key establishment over an insecure channel.

### 6. RSA Cipher
